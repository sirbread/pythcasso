# Run/Setup
1. Install required libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run `pythcasso.py`.
3. Follow on-screen instructions.
4. Wait ~3 hours (dependent on image size) for paint to fully "paint" the image, you can leave it on while you're at work/school on your PC.
5. Marvel at the creation. :)

# Important
Not all screens are the same resolution, so you may need to tweak the cursor's travel between the RGB values. This is optimized for 1920x1080 displays. 

# Tips
1. Use the "thick paintbrush" brush for landscapes/paintings at size 2.
2. Use the "pencil" at size 2 for smaller images (<200x200)
3. Use the "pencil" at size 3 for any other images.
4. If you need to stop mid-way, perform `Ctrl Alt Delete` to bring up the Windows menu options. There isn't any other safe way from your cursor to stop moving immediately.
