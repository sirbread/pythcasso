# Run/Setup
1. Install required libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run `pythcasso.py`.
3. Follow on-screen instructions.
4. Wait ~1 hour (dependent on image size) for paint to fully "paint" the image.
5. Marvel at the creation. :)

# Tips
1. Use the "thick paintbrush" brush for landscapes/paintings at size 2.
2. Use the "pencil" at size 2 for smaller images (<200x200)
3. Use the "pencil" at size 3 for any other images.
4. If you need to stop mid-way, perform `Ctrl Alt Delete` to bring up the Windows menu options. There isn't any other safe way from your cursor to stop moving immediately.
